I am **Dipankar Das**, an automation and platform engineer passionate about building **reliable, scalable, and sustainable systems** that eliminate repetitive tasks and accelerate developer productivity. I specialize in **DevOps, Kubernetes, cloud-native platforms, and infrastructure automation**, with a strong interest in **environmentally conscious computing** and reducing the carbon footprint of cloud workloads.  

I am an active **member of the Kubernetes organization** and have contributed to several **CNCF and open-source projects**, including **CNCF TAG Green**, **Kubernetes**, **Armo**, **Kubeshop**, **Cilium**, and more. My open-source work focuses on **improving developer workflows, benchmarking cloud-native applications, and building sustainable infrastructure tooling**.  

Currently, I work as a **DevOps Engineer (Platform Engineer) at [rtCamp](/posts/aboutme/#rtcamp)**, and I am also the **Founder of Ksctl**, a cloud-agnostic and carbon-aware Kubernetes lifecycle management tool. I have experience across **platform engineering, DevSecOps, MLOps, and infrastructure automation**, and I enjoy building solutions that **reduce operational complexity, increase reliability, and improve developer productivity**.
