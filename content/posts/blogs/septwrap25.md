What an incredible September it's been! This past month, I've been diving deep into some cutting-edge tech and exciting new projects. Here's a quick recap of my highlights:

**Cloud-Native & DevOps Adventures:**
*   Spearheaded the Email support with AWS SES integrations and came to know about DMARC, DKIM, and SPF configurations.
*   Explored advanced Terraform modules for Cloudflare, focusing on email routing and Google Groups integration.
*   Delved into the intricacies of `helm upgrade` for existing releases using `ksctl/ksctl` go package.

**Performance & Sustainability Focus:**
*   Gained extensive knowledge on RAPL and non-RAPL estimators for energy consumption, tackling challenges in cloud VM environments.
*   Pioneered platform-level addon support, with a successful POC for per-process/container energy consumption metrics.
*   Researched best practices for AI Agent tool creation from Anthropic and dived into Nvidia GPU operator blog posts.
*   Explored the nuances of grid carbon intensity (average vs. marginal) and the core, uncore, and package zones for RAPL.
*   Worked extensively with Kepler, Prometheus, and green metrics, including OCI-based Helm deployments.

**System Design & Core Infrastructure:**
*   Mastered raw HTTP calling of the K8s API server using `rest.Config` and `rest.Client`.
*   Explored `devicemapper` and thin loop devices, understanding their role in `containerd` for image storage.
*   Learned about `firecracker` for secure application delivery and the fascinating `gossip protocol`.
*   Deepened my understanding of `fluxcd` metalabels and `promQL` filtering.

**Product Development & Community:**
*   Contributed to new UI/UX designs and tackled complex Stripe checkout and quota system edge cases.
*   Explored state machines for real-world project applications.

It's been a month of intense learning, building, and contributing! Stay tuned for more updates on these exciting developments.
